Synopsis
-------------------------------------------

This was a project we made for the Hackers at Berkeley Chain Reaction
hackathon. Though we started this hack before the hackathon in order to
ensure that we finish it, we were given first place overall for the best
performance and the project that most embodied the spirit of the
hackathon.

Design
-------------------------------------------

In the beginning there was God, and a Node.js server hosting a single
static HTML page on which only traces of variables existed within lexical
scopes. There was no Earth, no Moon, no universe, but only a single
Facebook post on the Hackers at Berkeley Facebook page, seeking as
desperately to be liked as a teenage girl in some high school clique. "Like
me," it screamed with ferocity, "to see our chain reaction start!". Of
course, the only other being to hear was God, who, upon having this post
show up on his news feed every time he used for Facebook for over millions
of millenia, inevitably got a little annoyed. Finally, God couldn't take it
anymore. With his incredible hacking skills, he hacked together millions of
souls whose sole purpose was to like this post. Hopefully, if this
teenage-girl-Facebook-post had a bit of love, maybe it'll finally shut up.

So began the Genesis.

TLDR: Node.js server -> static web page -> queries Facebook post for likes
-> on certain number of likes, sends post request to server -> Node server
initiates bash script -> script initiates Arduino -> turns servo -> shoots
rubber band gun -> hits tape roll -> tape rolls down ramp -> tape hits
dominoes chain -> dominoes strike cereal-bar-enhanced mouse -> mouse clicks
Tkinter GUI -> initiates Python Twilio API to send text to Google Voice ->
Google Voice redirects to GMail -> JavaMail on Android phone detects new
email on GMail -> TRIGGERS MUSIC-PLAYING

Still TLDR: node -> web page -> facebook -> node trigger -> arduino ->
rubber band gun -> ball/ramp -> dominos -> mouse -> twilio -> google voice
-> javamail -> android -> music
